Decision Tree Python Implementation of Decision Tree Classifier Problem Statement: One of the very famous classification problems in Machine Learning is the IRIS Flower classification problem.Iris is the family in the flower which contains several species such as the Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, Iris virginica, etc.  In this tutorial you are going to Classify the three species of Iris family based on petal width, petal length, sepal length, and sepal width.

# Decision Tree
Decision Tree is a Supervised Machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.

In a Decision tree, there are two nodes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision nodes are used to make any decision and have multiple branches, whereas Leaf nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches. It is called a decision tree because, similar to a tree, it starts with the root node, which expands on further branches and constructs a tree-like structure.

In order to build a tree, we use the CART (Classification and Regression Tree) algorithm, which stands for Classification and Regression Tree algorithm.
A decision tree simply asks a question, and based on the answer ( Yes/No ), it further split the tree into subtrees.
Below diagram explains the general structure of a decision tree:
